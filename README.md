Overview of the Hotel Management System
📌 Project Summary
The Hotel Management System is a Java-based application designed to handle hotel operations like user registration, room management, booking reservations, and payments. The system uses Hibernate ORM for database interactions and MariaDB/MySQL as the database.

🎯 Objective
The primary goal of this project is to simplify hotel operations by providing an easy-to-use menu-driven system for managing:
✅ Users (Admins & Customers)
✅ Rooms (Availability, Pricing, and Room Types)
✅ Bookings (Reservations and Status Updates)
✅ Payments (Tracking Transactions)

🛠 Technologies Used
Java (JDK 8+) – Core development language
Hibernate ORM – Database interaction
MariaDB/MySQL – Data storage
JPA (Java Persistence API) – Entity management
Maven – Project build tool
